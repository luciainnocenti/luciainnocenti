‚û≠ <i><b>HERE I AM</b></i>  <br />
Passionate about technology and the future since forever, I graduated in computer engineering and I am pursuing the master's degree in Data Science. In parallel with my studies, I always look for new experiences that allow me to complete my profile and excite me.<br />


‚û≠ <i><b>WHAT I DID </b></i>  <br />
‚¨§ <b>Challenge@PoliTo by Firms - A. I. 4 fashion trends</b> <br />

‚¨§ JEToP: is a ‚Äújunior enterprise‚Äù, that is an association of students who offer services to companies. In JEToP I first held the role of IT Consultant and then that of General Manager, developing both technical Skills and important Soft Skills such as project management and team working     <br />

‚¨§ KPMG: a 6-month internship during my three-year degree in one of the BIG4s allowed me to put into practice many skills acquired during my studies and to learn how to use new tools. It was also important to learn the working methods of a large company, manage work under pressure and participate in projects with strict deadlines. <br />
  
  
‚û≠ <i><b>DATA SCIENCE PROJECTS</b></i>  <br />
