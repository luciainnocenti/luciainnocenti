### Hi there üëã

‚û≠ <i><b>HERE I AM</b></i>  <br />
Always passionate about technology and the future, I graduated in computer engineering and I am pursuing the MSc in Data Science. In parallel with my studies, I always look for new experiences that allow me to complete my profile and that excite me.<br />


‚û≠ <i><b>WHAT I DID </b></i>  <br />
  <b>‚¨§ Challenge@PoliTo by Firms - A. I. 4 fashion trends:</b> a challenge organized by @PoliTO and @EvoPricing, in which we looked for new approaches in artificial intelligence to better anticipate demand in the fashion field. As team, our goal was to develop and implement innovative approaches, collect data, and propose input factors for the development of an algorithm that foresees the evolution of fashion and future successful "styles". <br />

  <b>‚¨§ JEToP:</b>is a ‚Äújunior enterprise‚Äù, a student association offering consulting services to companies. In JEToP I first held the role of IT Consultant and then the role of General Manager, improving my technical skills and developing important soft skills such as project management and team working.    <br />

  <b>‚¨§ KPMG:</b>  a 6-month internship during my BSc in one of the BIG4s allowed me to put in practice many skills acquired during my studies and to get familiar with new tools. It was also important to learn the working methods of a large company, manage work under pressure and participate in projects with strict deadlines. <br />
